# Library-Database-Management-System

The aim of this project is to develop and deploy a database management system to aid in the organization and management of a public library. This system will help the library staff to manage their library resources, including books, magazines, digital media, and other materials. Moreover, it will provide a streamlined approach to accessing library memberâ€™s information and facilitate the borrowing and tracking of library materials. The library management system will prioritize data integrity and aim to reduce redundancy for both the library staff and members.
